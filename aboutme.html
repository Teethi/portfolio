        Hello, I'm Teethi Kanthe, an enthusiastic and driven engineering undergraduate with a passion for coding, analytical problem-solving, and leadership. My journey in the world of technology has been marked by a commitment to utilizing my skills and experiences to make a positive impact on the community.

One of my ongoing projects, the Health Risk Assessment Application Module, embodies this commitment. 
This innovative questionnaire-based application module is designed to collect comprehensive data from users, ranging from body profiles and nutrition to lifestyle and emotional well-being. It harnesses this data to generate a cumulative report, highlighting key focus areas. Beyond its potential to improve personal health, this module also has a broader societal impact—it enables companies to analyze clients' needs and recommend suitable insurance schemes. The technology stack behind this project includes Flutter for the frontend, Asp.net Core for the backend, and PostGRESQL for the database.
<br> <br>
Another notable achievement in my journey was being among the top 5 teams in the Barclays Data Stellar Hackathon, where I developed the OnBoardPro application. This dynamic tool streamlines the customer onboarding process with features such as phone-based OTP verification, face recognition, document verification, and liveliness checks—essential components for KYC (Know Your Customer) processes. The tech stack for this project includes Flutter for the frontend, Firebase for the backend, GCP (Google Cloud Platform), Flask for REST APIs, and Google ML Kit for advanced features like face recognition. It also incorporates essential security measures, such as AES encryption and GitHub for version control.

My experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a sense of responsibility to leverage technology for the greater good. I am excited about the opportunities ahead to further contribute to our community through innovative solutions and leadership.

<br><br>Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to make a positive difference together.
